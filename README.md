# React-Playground

## Random acts of React

This is a scratch pad where I try things out in React.

Some of pages are simply notes, or tidbits I found on a blog or in a project. Other pages might be syntax pratice / experements with an npm package or some CSS. Other components are thigns I want to try outside of another app before I decide how to use them. Some of it is for fun.
