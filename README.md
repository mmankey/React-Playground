# React-Playground

## Random acts of React

This is a space where I try things out in React.  Some of this is like [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/) where I make a few notes / examples.   Other parts just syntax pratice / experements with an npm package or just some CSS, others are just thigns I want to try outside of another app before I decide how to use them.   Some of it is just for fun.
